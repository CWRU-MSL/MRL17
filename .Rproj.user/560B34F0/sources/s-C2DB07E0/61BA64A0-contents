### Reference Coordinate System

  - Each File (whether it is Hardness data, EDS Data, or EBSD Data) has its own local coordinate system defined by its origin and step size (different/same for two axes)
  - (disp.ref.z, disp.ref.x): Represents the location of Origin with respect to reference co-ordinate system 
  - (dz, dx): Represents the step size of the local(of the file under study) co-ordinate system
  - For combining different Data Files/Sets - we use our reference co-ordinate system defined by a fixed origin or marked at the same position across different samples (each sample has the same dimensions)
  - Using reference, positions of origins, and step size for each data file we can calculate the co-ordinates in reference system. Once we know the coordinates of all data points in reference coordinate system, we can merge into a single data frame
  - All distance measurements in reference co-ordinate system are in millimeters (mm), unless specified for a particular variable
